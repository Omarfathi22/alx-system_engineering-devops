Definitions and Explanations.

What is a server: A server is a hardware device, a virtual machine, or a software application that provides functionalities for other programs or devices, known as “clients.”

What is the role of a domain name: A domain name is used to identify Internet resources, such as computers, networks, and services, with a text-based label that is easier to remember than numerical addresses (IP addresses).

What type of DNS record is www in https://app.smartdraw.com/: It is a ‘CNAME’ record.

What is the role of the Web Server: The role of a Web Server is to store, process, and display website content (codebase); it delivers web pages to users (primarily HTML and CSS) over the HTTP protocol.

What is the role of the application server: The application server's role is to generate dynamic content by executing server-side code such as JSP, Ajax, PHP, etc.

What is the role of the database: The database's role is to manage data systematically and efficiently, allowing data to be easily added, accessed, updated, managed, and deleted.

What does the server use to communicate with the user's computer requesting the website: The server communicates via the HTTP protocol.

Issues

A. SPOF (Single Point Of Failure): There are numerous single points of failure, starting from having a single server that houses the web server, application server, and database. A single point of failure is a component of a system that, if it fails, will halt the entire system's operation.

B. Downtime when maintenance is required (like deploying new code, the web server needs to be restarted): The downtime could be longer than anticipated because the server relies on a single code base, which is unavailable during maintenance. Consequently, users will be unable to access the website and its content, leading to a poor user experience and a loss of traffic.

C. Inability to scale with high incoming traffic: The domain name points directly at the server, which lacks a load balancer to handle increased traffic more efficiently. This limitation can negatively impact the user experience and restrict the number of users the website can accommodate.
